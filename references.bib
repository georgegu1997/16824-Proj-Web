  abstract = "We propose a benchmark for 6D pose estimation of a rigid object
              from a single RGB-D input image. The training data consists of a
              texture-mapped 3D object model or images of the object in known
              6D poses. The benchmark comprises of: i) eight datasets in a
              uniﬁed format that cover diﬀerent practical scenarios, including
              two new datasets focusing on varying lighting conditions, ii) an
              evaluation methodology with a pose-error function that deals with
              pose ambiguities, iii) a comprehensive evaluation of 15 diverse
              recent methods that captures the status quo of the ﬁeld, and iv)
              an online evaluation system that is open for continuous
              submission of new results. The evaluation shows that methods
              based on point-pair features currently perform best,
              outperforming template matching methods, learning-based methods
              and methods based on 3D local features. The project website is
